<span class=heading>INTRODUCTION</span>
<p>
The goal of my final project was to implement as much of Holtkamper's
paper describing a real-time and interactive smoke and steam
simulation [1] as possible.  Holtkamper's method emphasizes real-time
simulation and visually correct interaction between the smoke and
objects in the virtual environment.  Although I did not have time to
implement the interaction of the smoke with objects in the environment,
my project allows for different visual styles of smoke and
arbitrary wind-like forces to be applied to the smoke.
<p>

<span class=heading>BACKGROUND</span>
<p>
Three major previous techniques for simulating smoke are particle
system simulation, image synthesis and physically-based simulation.
In particles systems, single particles or clusters of particles move
through the simulation space.  Their positions and velocities are
updated according to simple force equations.  Particle systems tend to
be much more flexible than other simulation methods.  Image synthesis
methods of smoke simulation typically modulate Perlin's noise function
[2] to yield density for display.  However, image synthesis methods
are limited by their inability to easily include arbitrary objects in
the simulation.  Physically-based simulations of smoke typically
compute the Navier-Strokes equations.  This can yield high-quality
renderings, but the computational cost is high.  Equation solvers of
this sort can also be limited by their solution domain; it can again
be difficult to include arbitrary objects.
<p>

<span class=heading>SIMULATION OVERVIEW</span>
<p>
The simulation approach taken by Holtkamper involves combining
particle systems with image synthesis and some rendering tricks.  The
particles are rendered as semi-transparent textured billboards.

<p>

<span class=heading>TURBULENCE SPACE</span>
<p>
The turbulence space is where the turbulent appearance of the smoke is
calculated.  Turbulence space is nothing more than a function
modulating Perlin noise:
<br>
<div class=image><img src="img1.png"></div>

At certain intervals, sources release new particle clusters into the
simulation.  A source maintains its position in the turbulence space.
Within the volume of the source, the turbulence space is sampled at
random positions, one for each particle in the new cluster.  The
sampled values are assigned as densities to the particles.  After
generating a new cluster, the source moves through the turbulence
space in a direction opposite the velocity of the cluster it just
created and the cluster is released into the simulation space.  The
movement of the sources through turbulence space contributes to the
turbulent look of the smoke.

<p>
<span class=heading>PARTICLE SIMULATION</span>
<p>
Once a particle cluster is released into the simulation space, it is
now under control of the particle system.  Each cluster has a
position, velocity and temperature.  The individual particles in each
cluster maintain their own densities.
<p>
The position and velocity of each cluster are updated each timestep by
the equations
<div class=image><img src="img2.png"></div>
and
<div class=image><img src="img3.png"></div>
The force is given by the sum of gravitational, convection,
frictional and user-defined forces:
<div class=image><img src="img4.png"></div>
<div class=image><img src="img5.png"></div>
<div class=image><img src="img6.png"></div>
<div class=image><img src="img7.png"></div>
<div class=image><img src="img8.png"></div>
The user-defined global force can be specified as beginning and end
magnitudes and directions for a specified duration.  The force is
smoothly interpolated over the duration.
<p>
The smoke also gradually dissolves during its movement due to a
dissipation calculation applied to each particle that attenuates its
density:
<div class=image><img src="img9.png"></div>
The values of the constants in these equations have physical bases
that are explained in Appendix A of the paper.
<p>

<span class=heading>PARTICLE RENDERING</span>
<p>
The particles are rendered as semi-transparent textured billboards
with alpha values set to their densities.  The billboards are oriented
to always face the viewer.  In order to reduce rendering artifacts
from alpha blending, the particles are sorted and rendered in
back-to-front order.  The images below show the Gaussian texture used
and what the simulation looks like without and with the texture applied.

<span class=heading>CONCLUSIONS</span>
<p>
My simulation runs in real-time, as desired.  I ran the simulation
>1000 clusters with 10 particles/cluster at 1000x1000 resolution and
the framerate was real-time.  The test machine was a P4 2.4GHz using a
GeForce4 Ti 4200 graphics card.  I think the simulation looks
reasonably realistic.  The movies (linked at the top of this page)
demonstrate the simulation much better than still pictures.  Compared
to the movies provided by Holtkamper, I think my simulation lives up
to the visual quality of his.
<p>

<span class=heading>FUTURE WORK</span>
<p>
One of my original extended goals was to include objects in the
simulation that the smoke would interact with.  A method to do this is
described in the paper, albeit not entirely clearly.  Ideally the
objects could move dynamically.  And as always, it would also be neat
to displace some of the processing of the simulation to the GPU.
