README

This project implements much of the smoke simulation system described
in Holtkamper, T. Real-time Gaseous Phenomena - A Phenomenological
Approach to Interactive Smoke and Stream. 2003.  A concentration is
made on the visual effect of the smoke, rather than a
physically-correct simulation.

COMPILING

The program compiles on Linux using the provided Makefile.  I used
David McAllister's Particle Systems API
<URL:http://www.cs.unc.edu/~davemc/Particle/>, but had to modify the
API to allow finer-grained control over individual particles.  The
modified API code is provided in the particle/ directory.  The program
also requires the ImageMagick and GLUI libraries.

CONTROLS

The simulation and rendering parameters can be changed via the GUI.
The W, A, S and D keys allow the view to be translated and rotated,
always facing the smoke.  The T and G keys translate in the
z-direction.

MOVIES

The program can output screendumps as it runs.  The provided Makefile
can generate a movie from the screendumps, given that mencoder
<URL:http://www.mplayerhq.hu> is installed by using 'make movie'.
